#Enhance the Chatroom

The following three challenges were applied:

- Broadcast and display a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- Display a count of how many users are connected
- Add support for nicknames

I chose not to apply any further functionality because the documentation over at socket.io is lacking. The example provided by them (chat.socket.io) is a great guide as to how things work. But for this exercise it seems like it is cheating.
